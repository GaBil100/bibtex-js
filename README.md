**[Install it on your website!](wiki/Installation.md)**

BibTeX-js can parse a BibTeX-file and render it as part of an HTML file. This way, you can easily add a list of publications to your private homepage or display a list of recommended publications for a seminar. The way the entries are display can be customized using a simple template system and CSS.

* Fast parser written in pure javascript (parser is in O(n))
* No setup required, drop-in solution
* Fallback option for clients without javascript (to be implemented)
